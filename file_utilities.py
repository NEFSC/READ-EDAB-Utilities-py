Purpose:
    FILE_UTILITIES is a collection of utility functions for handling file paths, directories, and permissions.

Main Functions:
    - file_make: Checks to see if a file exists and if it needs to be remade based on the mtimes of the input files
    - set_file_permissions: Checks the permissions of a file and changes them if they don't match the desired permissions.

Helper Functions:
    - validate_inputs: Validates that input data arrays are xarray.DataArray and have matching shapes
